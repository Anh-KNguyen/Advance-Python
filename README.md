    generators - function that returns iterable (generator) objects by calling yield.
  
    Calling next() on a generator iterable resumes the execution from where yield was called (not at the beginning of the fuunction)

    sort() - changes on hard copy. in-place sorting
    
    sorted() - returns a copy because an interable is passed in. You cannot "change" an iterable
